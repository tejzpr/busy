# About
Busy is a mouse movement simulator. It stops your system from going to sleep / idling and makes sure that you keep getting those notifications while you take that well deserved break.

# Download
Download executables for Mac OS (Darwin), Linux & Windows from [here](https://github.com/tejzpr/busy/releases)


# How-to
Start it up before you move away from your screen. It will send periodic mouse movements to keep the session alive so that you may get any notifications that may not show up if the system goes to sleep during short periods of inactivity.
